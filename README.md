👋 Hi there — I'm Q (Quinn Vidal)

Security engineer and automation architect building scalable solutions that bridge cloud, infrastructure, and AI. I design secure OT/IoT environments, automate critical workflows with Python, and deploy self-hosted systems — from Proxmox clusters running 20+ VMs to AI inference servers and network monitoring dashboards.

## 🔧 What I Work With

**☁️ Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3) · Azure · Docker Swarm · Nginx · GitHub Actions · Cloudflare

**🧠 AI & Infrastructure:** Ollama/LLaMA · OpenWebUI · Elasticsearch · UniFi Networks · Grafana Dashboards · Zabbix

**🔐 Security & Monitoring:** OT/IoT Risk Assessments · Network Segmentation · SIEM (Splunk) · DNS Security · Automated Alerting

**🛠️ Automation & Code:** Python (APIs, monitoring, data pipelines) · Bash · Infrastructure as Code · Home Assistant · Zigbee/Thread

## 🌱 Current Focus

• Building AI-powered network monitoring and alerting systems
• Developing Python automation frameworks for infrastructure management
• Scaling hybrid cloud deployments with automated security controls
• Exploring AI agent integration with self-hosted infrastructure
